import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)

3. Create src/App.jsx (The most important one!)
 * Right-click the src folder -> New File -> Name it App.jsx
 * PASTE: Go back to my previous reply (the one with the "StuffKeeperApp" code that I said was "fully fixed and optimized"). Copy that entire long code block and paste it here.
Step 4: Run the Application
 * In VS Code, at the top menu, click Terminal > New Terminal.
 * A window will pop up at the bottom.
 * Type this command and hit Enter (this installs the libraries):
   npm install

   (Wait for it to finish. You will see a node_modules folder appear).
 * Type this command and hit Enter (this starts the app):
   npm run dev
